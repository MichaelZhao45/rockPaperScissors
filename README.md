Start of Project - August 8, 2023

This is the start of the Oden Project Rock Paper Scissors project that involves java script.  I'm hoping this project will give me a solid foundation in using basic javascipt in my web development.  Thus, this project will teach me functions, conditions and practical problem solving skills on the web.
