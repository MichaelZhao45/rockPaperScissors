Start of Project - August 8, 2023

This is the start of the Oden Project Rock Paper Scissors project that involves java script.  I'm hoping this project will give me a solid foundation in using basic javascipt in my web development.  Thus, this project will teach me functions, conditions and practical problem solving skills on the web.

Actaul Start - Sept 23, 2023

This is the actual start of this project.  During the month of August and Beginning of September, I unfortunately got quite busy with work and getting ready for the new school year.  However, I'm back at it, settled in and ready for the challenge!
