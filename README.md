Start of Project - August 8, 2023
- This is the start of the Oden Project Rock Paper Scissors project that involves java script.  I'm hoping this project will give me a solid foundation in using basic javascipt in my web development.  Thus, this project will teach me functions, conditions and practical problem solving skills on the web.

Actaul Start - Sept 23, 2023
- This is the actual start of this project.  During the month of August and Beginning of September, I unfortunately got quite busy with work and getting ready for the new school year.  However, I'm back at it, settled in and ready for the challenge!

getComputerChoice and playRound Functions - Sept 27, 2023
- Finished the getComputerChoice and playRound functions.  The getComputerChoice returns the computer's choice for rock paper or scissors.  As for the playRound function, it takes in two parameters, playerSelection which is case-insensitive, as I used the toLowerCase() and computerChoice.  Moreover, it looks at the conditions and spits out who won, computer or player.

Java Script Finished - Sept 29, 2023
- Finished the game() function which tracked player and computer wins and outputs who won the match.  Now that the game() function has been completed, the java script portion of the RPS Project has been finished.  The design of the project and interface will need to be worked on next.

Added User Interface - Nov 1, 2023
- Came back to the Oden Project and needed to design a user interface that worked with buttons instead of using the console.
- Created user interface, all that is left is to design and make the interface look better
