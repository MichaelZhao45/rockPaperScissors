Start of Project - August 8, 2023

This is the start of the Oden Project Rock Paper Scissors project that involves java script.  I'm hoping this project will give me a solid foundation in using basic javascipt in my web development.  Thus, this project will teach me functions, conditions and practical problem solving skills on the web.

getComputerChoice and playRound Functions - Sept 27, 2023

Finished the getComputerChoice and playRound functions.  The getComputerChoice returns the computer's choice for rock paper or scissors.  As for the playRound function, it takes in two parameters, playerSelection which is case-insensitive, as I used the toLowerCase() and computerChoice.  Moreover, it looks at the conditions and spits out who won, computer or player.
